# NFT Responsive Site

The goal is to create a responsive site for showcasing NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). By working on this project, we learn various concepts related to building a responsive website like:

1. Thinking "responsively": Think about how a website should adapt and respond to different screen sizes and devices.

2. Relative CSS units: Explore and utilize relative CSS units such as percentages, ems, and rems to create flexible and scalable designs.

3. Relative line height: Learn how to use relative line heights to ensure consistent vertical spacing and readability across different devices.

4. Media queries: Implement media queries to apply specific styles and layout changes based on different screen widths, allowing a site to adapt to various devices.

5. Mobile-first design strategy: Adopt a mobile-first approach, focusing on designing and developing for smaller screens first and then progressively enhancing the layout for larger screens.

6. Responsive site navigation: Implement a responsive navigation menu that adjusts its layout and appearance based on the available screen space.

7. flex-wrap, flex, and gap: Leverage CSS flexbox properties like `flex-wrap`, `flex`, and `gap` to create responsive and flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and content.

## Features
